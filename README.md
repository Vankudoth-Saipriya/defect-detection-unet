# 🧠 Defect Detection in Additive Manufacturing using U-Net

This project implements a semantic segmentation pipeline using a U-Net model to detect and localize various defects in grayscale images from powder bed fusion-based metal 3D printing. The goal is to automate quality inspection by identifying 11 defect types during both powder spreading and post-melting phases.

## 📌 Overview

- Automates defect detection in high-resolution layer-wise images.
- Trains a custom U-Net model for multi-class segmentation.
- Works on grayscale image data labeled at the pixel level.
- Targets industrial inspection in metal additive manufacturing.
